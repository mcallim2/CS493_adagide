Team Notes:

10/8/12

I think this could be a great place to leave notes (if needed). This can be more day-to-day
so this is different than the read me.

The xxx project is just a stub but now you guys can bring that down and get it all hooked up with
Eclipse (we can work on this together tomorrow) - it took some doing but now I think its good to go
for me!

Time to get down to business!!!
